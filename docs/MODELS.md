# Payroll Management System Models

This document provides a detailed overview of the data models used in the Payroll Management System. Each model represents a specific entity in the system and is used to store and manage related information. The models are designed to work together to facilitate the various functionalities of the system, such as employee management, attendance tracking, leave management, and salary management.

Below, you will find a description of each model, including its fields and usage in the system.

## AttendancePolicy Model

- `description`: A detailed description of the attendance policy. It provides more information about the rules and expectations of the policy.
